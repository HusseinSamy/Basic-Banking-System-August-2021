# About

This was a graduation project from a C++ course that I have enrolled in on site (ItSharks - Maadi branch).

We were asked to create a console app where:

* Admins can:
  * Add, Remove, Update Delete books.
 * Students can:
 * Borrow books
* Return books

It was a simple application but I have applied most of the concepts that I have learned throughout the course like:

* Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * Classes
  * Objects
  * Constructor
  * Destructor
  * Access Modifiers
  * Encapsulation
  
* Control Statements
* Loops
* Functions
* Arrays
* Vectors
* Structs
* Input & Output streaming

You can find the course's curriculum [here](https://itsharks.co/c/mobile-app/course/c-plus-plus).

I also want to mention that I was asked to create only one project but I was able to create 2 projects
 (You can find the other one [here](https://github.com/HusseinSamy/Basic-Library-System-Aug-2021-)) while 
 all my fellows were struggling creating their first project and I was honored for being a top-notch student 
 and discussed how I have built the project in front of all the class.
